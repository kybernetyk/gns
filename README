Ghetto GPS Navigation System
----------------------------
Because turn by turn is for losers!


Features:
	- System like in Crazy Taxi / GTA - just an arrow showing the general direction to the destination
	- Arrival time is specified by user. No estimation. You just enter a hard time limit when you have to be there and if you don't make it you lose. Encourages reckless driving in cities. Win!
	- Elitesque ASCII Art output
	- Works on my machine, which is a pretty damn nice Toughbook that would survive a nuclear war


Deps:
	- Linux (any Ubonto will do) in text mode
	- Clang with C++11 support (3.2 svn+ should do it)
	- A NMEA 0183 compilant GPS Mouse 
	- A NMEA 0183 compilant compass (I built my own from scrap metal and homeless Arduinos)
	- Balls to use it
